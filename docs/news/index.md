- **Customizable Deployment Options**: Developers can now override `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`, `amount`, and other deployment parameters, offering greater control over contract deployment.
- **Existing Contract Interaction**: This feature allows users to connect to and interact with already deployed contracts, streamlining the development process.
- **Node Modules Update**: Keeping dependencies fresh, the node modules have been updated to ensure compatibility and security.
- **Dependabot Fixes**: Addressing potential vulnerabilities, dependabot issues have been resolved to maintain the integrity of the plugin.
- **ESlint Over TSLint**: Embracing the industry shift, the plugin has transitioned from TSLint to ESlint, reflecting best practices in code quality and maintainability.
- **Deployment Builder**: A new deployment builder has been introduced for cleaner and more readable contract deployment code.

These updates reflect our commitment to providing a robust and developer-friendly environment for Zilliqa blockchain development. Dive into the new features by visiting the [Hardhat Scilla Plugin repository](https://github.com/Zilliqa/hardhat-scilla-plugin).
