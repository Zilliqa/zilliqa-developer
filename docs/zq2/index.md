# Zilliqa 2: An Overview

## Introduction

Zilliqa 2 is the next generation of the Zilliqa blockchain. It represents a fundamental overhaul of Zilliqa's blockchain node, introducing substantial improvements in network performance and utility while preserving all the features of the current Zilliqa version, including full EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatibility.

It is currently under development, so not yet stable or complete, feel free to create an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/Zilliqa/zq2) when you find problems.

## Key Enhancements in Zilliqa 2

Zilliqa 2 brings forth several enhancements to elevate its performance and scalability:

- **Faster Finality**: Introducing a new consensus algorithm (Fast-HotStuff) for quicker transaction confirmations.

- **Improved Scalability and Sharding**: The upgrade empowers developers with an enhanced sharding system, providing the flexibility to create custom shards with programmable security parameters.

- **Developer-Focused Design**: Prioritizing an enhanced developer experience, Zilliqa 2.0 aims to simplify blockchain development and streamline user transactions.

- **Programmable Model and EVM Compatibility**: The upgrade embraces a programmer's model heavily based on EVM, allowing smart contracts to modify blockchain behavior without altering underlying code. Full support for both Scilla and EVM is retained.

- **Sharding System with Privacy Features**: Zilliqa 2.0's sharding system supports programmable decentralization, enabling customization of shards for specific use cases. Each shard includes an encryption key, ensuring privacy by encrypting block data.

## Compatibility and Transition

In terms of compatibility and transition:

- **Existing ZIL and dApps**: Zilliqa 2 ensures a seamless transition by maintaining compatibility with existing Zilliqa and EVM APIs. Users can rest assured that their decentralized applications (dApps) will continue to function normally, with the state of the chain remaining unchanged.

- **Deployment and Stability**: The current phase involves a heavily in-development devnet that aligns with the latest code changes. Users should anticipate some instability and occasional state resets. As Zilliqa 2 matures, the plan is to deploy additional networks offering enhanced stability.

## Deployment and Stability

Presently, there is a heavily in-development devnet that stays aligned with the latest code changes. Users should anticipate some instability and occasional state resets during this phase. As Zilliqa 2 matures, the plan is to deploy additional networks that offer greater stability.
