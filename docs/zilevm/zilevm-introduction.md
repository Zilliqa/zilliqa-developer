#### ZILEVM clients

ZILEVM should work with most popular EVM clients and wallets, including [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) and [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/).

#### ZILEVM block explorers

For now, use:

* [Viewblock](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa?network=testnet)
* [DevEx](https://devex.zilliqa.com/?network=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-api.zilliqa.com)

In particular, DevEx is capable of translating between ethereum and Zilliqa style addresses (use the recycle button next to the address in the account page).

#### ZILEVM testnet faucet

You can use the [testnet faucet](../dev-dapps/dev-tools-faucet.md) to add ZIL to your EVM account; just paste your ethereum address (given by your wallet) into the faucet destination address.
