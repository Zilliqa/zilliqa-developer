## Getting Started with Zilliqa EVM

### Resources

#### Quick connect guide

[Guide on configuring Metamask to ZILEVM](../onboard/onboard-metamask.md)

#### Developer onboarding

[Guides for developing Solidity contracts for ZILEVM](../developer-onboarding/dev-onboarding-introduction.md)

##### Zilliqa Mainnet

EVM is not yet available on Zilliqa Mainnet

##### Developer testnet

| Network Type | Network Name | Network RPC                       | ChainID | Currency Symbol | Block Explorer URL                         |

| Mainnet      |              |                                   |         |                 |                                            |

#### ZILEVM block explorers

Use:

- [Viewblock](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa?network=testnet)
- [DevEx](https://devex.zilliqa.com/?network=https%3A%2F%2Fdev-api.zilliqa.com)

In particular, DevEx is capable of translating between ethereum and Zilliqa
style addresses (use the recycle button next to the address in the account
page).

#### ZILEVM testnet faucet

You can use the
[testnet faucet](../../developers/developer-toolings/dev-tools-faucet.md) to add
ZIL to your EVM account; just paste your ethereum address (given by your wallet)
into the faucet destination address.
