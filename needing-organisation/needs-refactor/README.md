## Scope

This repository is essentially a knowledge base for all the developers inside Zilliqa. We encourage you to share any knowledge in any perspective about development.

The docs are organized by topics and located in different categories. This keeps the repository clean and tidy. If you have better idea in organizing the docs, please [contribute](#contributing)!

## Viewing
