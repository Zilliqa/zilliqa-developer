## Structure

The docs are organized by topics and located in different categories. This keeps the repository clean and tidy. If you have better idea in organizing the docs, please [contribute](#contributing)!

## Viewing

You can read the docs on Github directly or use any markdown rendering engine locally. We suggest using [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) as both viewing and editing tools for markdown docs.

## Searching

Github already did the indexing for you. Key in your keywords in the search bar and look for your interested topics.

## Contributing

Create an [issue](https://github.com/Zilliqa/dev-docs/issues) when you feel something can be improved.

To contribute with new information or make changes to existing documentation, please read the [Contributing Guideline](contributing.md).
