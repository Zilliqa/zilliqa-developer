## Structure

The docs are organized by topics and located in different categories. This keeps the repository clean and tidy. If you have better idea in organizing the docs, please [contribute](#contributing)!

```
├── core
│   └── images
├── devops
│   └── images
└── images
    └── logs
        └── dev-docs-log.png
```

## Viewing

You can read the docs on Github directly or use any markdown rendering engine locally. We suggest using [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) as both viewing and editing tools for markdown docs.

## Searching

Github already did the indexing for you. Key in your keywords in the search bar and look for your interested topics.

## Contributing

To contribute with new information or make changes to existing documentation, please read the [Contributing Guideline](contributing.md).
