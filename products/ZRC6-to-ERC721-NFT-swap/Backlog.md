## 25 Implement the _transferEvmNFTs

- Transfer NFTs from _evmNFTAddress according to the `nftSwapMapping`
- Assume that swapping contract has the approvals to transfer the NFTs

## 027 Add tooltips and descriptions in UI to make the application straightforward to use

## 028 Modify the web UI around minting new Scilla NFTs

so it is better described that minting the new Scilla NFT is for testing purpose only and normally, for other collections, users would need to acquire NFTs outside of the swaping app
