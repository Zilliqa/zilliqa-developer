## 026 Add approve the EVM wallet as NFTs operator by ZilPay wallet

The swapping process requires EVM wallet to be an operator of Scilla NFTs to burn them.
Implement a UI and a Scilla smart contract call that does that before swapping. 

## 027 Add tooltips and descriptions in UI to make the application straightforward to use

## 028 Modify the web UI around minting new Scilla NFTs

so it is better described that minting the new Scilla NFT is for testing purpose only and normally, for other collections, users would need to acquire NFTs outside of the swaping app
