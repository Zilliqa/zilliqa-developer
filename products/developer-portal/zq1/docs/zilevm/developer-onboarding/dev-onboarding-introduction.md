## Developer Onboarding Introduction

If you are new to Solidity and looking to learn the basics of the language, there are a few guides that can provide a good starting point. These can include:

- The Solidity documentation

This is the official reference guide for Solidity, and it provides detailed information on the language's syntax, features, and built-in libraries. The documentation also includes a number of examples and tutorials that can help you learn the basics of Solidity. Check the [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org) for more information.

- The Solidity tutorial on the Ethereum website

This is a comprehensive tutorial that covers the basics of Solidity, as well as more advanced topics such as contract design patterns and security considerations. Check the [documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/) for more information.

- The Solidity course on the CryptoZombies website
  This is an interactive, game-like learning platform that teaches Solidity through a series of lessons and exercises. It is a fun and engaging way to learn the basics of Solidity and get started with building your own contracts. Check the [documentation](https://cryptozombies.io/) for more information.
- The Solidity section of the Truffle documentation

If you are using the Truffle development framework, the Truffle documentation includes a number of guides and tutorials specifically focused on Solidity development. Check the [documentation](truffle.md) for more information.

In addition to these guides, there are also many other resources available online, such as blog posts, videos, and forums, that can provide useful information and tips for learning Solidity.
