# Zilliqa Developer Portal

This is the developer documentation for [Zilliqa](https://www.zilliqa.com/) 2.0, a fast-finality scalable blockchain.

You can read the white paper and get an overview of Zilliqa 2.0 and how it works from TODO.

Zilliqa supports both an EVM compatible execution layer and a custom execution layer based on the [Scilla](https://scilla.readthdocs.io/latest) smart contract language. Standards for the blockchain itself are recorded in [Zilliqa Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/zilliqa/zip) and for Scilla smart contracts, in [Zilliqa Reference Contracts](https://github.com/zilliqa/zrc). Chain governance can be discussed on [the governance forum](https://gov.zilliqa.com) and votes are held on [snapshot](https://governance.zilliqa.com), and staking information can be obtained from [zillion](https://stake.zilliqa.com).

You can find out more about how EVM and Scilla [interoperate](/interop.md).

Zilliqa supports most standard EVM development tools and wallets, including [metamask](https://metamask.io).

**_NB: The current production version of Zilliqa is Zilliqa 1 - you can find documentation on Zilliqa 1 at [https://dev.zilliqa.com](https://dev.zilliqa.com)_**
