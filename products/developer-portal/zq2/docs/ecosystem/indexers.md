# Zilliqa Indexers and data ingest

Zilliqa 2 EVM supports [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/) ; it is hoped that we will have a Zilliqa native plugin available.

[pdt](https://github.com/Zilliqa/zilliqa-developer/tree/main/products/pdt) is capable of ingesting Zilliqa data into Postgres or BigQuery for analysis.

There is a [Legacy ZQ1 indexer](../indexer/indexer-introduction/) available, but be aware that improvements to this codebase are no longer being made.
