# Ethereum API

We aim to support a useful subset of the available Ethereum Node methods. Useful references include
[Ethereum JSON-RPC API methods](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) and [the Geth RPC docs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-debug).

The exact set of API methods we intend to support will be published in a future [ZIP](https://github.com/zilliqa/zip).

See [endpoints](/endpoints.md) for details of which RPC endpoints are supported by each deployed version of Zilliqa 2.0 (TBD: this information will eventually be extracted here for convenience).
