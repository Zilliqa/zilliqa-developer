# Network Upgrade

This doc describes the way to conduct the upgrade entire network. So far we implement the following 2 methods:

- Upgrade on Separated Network
- Rolling Upgrade

Here is a comparison table between these 2 methods, and meanwhile, the methods would be applied in different scenarios.

|                   |Upgrade on Separated Network|Rolling Upgrade           |
|-------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
|Speed              |Fast (2 hrs)                |Slow (2 days)             |
|User Experience    |Sense time-shifting         |Seamless and Ethereum adopt [this](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/02/22/ethereum-constantinople-st-petersburg-upgrade-announcement/)|
|Changes Take Effect|Immediately                 |Delayed by specified epoch|
|Transaction History|Drop                        |Keep                      |
|Once Failed        |Try again                   |Target testnet destroyed  |

Following is detail steps of how to apply these 2 upgrade procedures on the entire network.

## Upgrade on Separated Network

- [Log-in to mkops](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SMnflWGmGQGc3qJOOlGtq-85eBYuyQUg1fjkZlcSIKo/edit)

  ```bash
  ssh mkops
  cd testnet
  ```

- Under `testnet` folder, bootstrap a separate testnet `<new_testnet>` from the original cluster/testnet (`<ori_cluster>`/`<ori_testnet>`).

  ```bash
  ./bootstrap.py <new_testnet> --recover-from-testnet <ori_testnet> --recover-from-cluster <ori_cluster> -c <commit> -t <tag>...
  cd <new_testnet>
  ```

  Keep the options the same as much as possible from the `<ori_testnet>`'s bootstrap options.

- Under `<new_testnet>` folder, upload `<ori_testnet>`'s persistence to S3.

  ```bash
  ./testnet.sh upload <ori_cluster> <ori_testnet>
  ```

  Go to [AWS webpage](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/zilliqa-persistence/?region=ap-southeast-1&tab=overview) and make sure `<ori_testnet>.tar.gz` is uploaded to `S3://zilliqa-persistence`.

- (Optional, **Time-machine**) If you want to restore previous tx block in current ds epoch, upload `<ori_testnet>`'s persistence to S3 with given `<restoredBlockNum>`.

  ```bash
  ./testnet.sh upload <ori_cluster> <ori_testnet> level2lookup 0 <restoredBlockNum>
  ```

- Manually confirm the correctness of constant file inside `configmap/constants.xml`.

- Launch `<new_testnet>`.

  ```bash
  ./testhet.sh up
  ```

- After `<new_testnet>` being launched, remove unnecessary files (`ipMapping.xml`, used to map `<ori_testnet>`'s IP to `<new_testnet>`'s IP).

  ```bash
  ./testnet.sh remove-ipMap
  ```

## Rolling Upgrade

- [Log-in to mkops](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SMnflWGmGQGc3qJOOlGtq-85eBYuyQUg1fjkZlcSIKo/edit)

  ```bash
  ssh mkops
  ```

- Download Zilliqa/Scilla, and check-out to the commit-to-be-upgraded.

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Zilliqa/Zilliqa.git (Mandatory)
  git reset --hard <commit-to-be-upgraded>
  git clone git@github.com:Zilliqa/scilla.git (Optional, download it ONLY when you want to upgrade Scilla)
  ```

  Note that rolling upgrade ONLY can upgrade Zilliqa or Scilla at a time.

- Run `Zilliqa/build/bin/genkeypair` several times to generate some privKey/pubKey pairs, then paste the keys into 2 separated files named `privKeyFile` and `pubKeyFile`.

  ```bash
  ./Zilliqa/build/bin/genkeypair
  ```

- Edit `Zilliqa/scripts/release.sh`.

  ```console
  privKeyFile="../key/privKeyFile"
  pubKeyFile="../key/pubKeyFile"
  testnet_to_be_upgraded="<target_testnet>"
  cluster_name="<target_cluster>"         # eg: dev.k8s.z7a.xyz
  releaseZilliqa="true"                   # "true" for Zilliqa upgrade, "false" for Scilla upgrade
  scillaPath=""                           # "" for Zilliqa upgrade, "<scilla_path>" for Scilla upgrade
  ```

  Note the variables `<target_testnet>`, `<target_cluster>`, `<scilla_path>` should be changed properly.

- Release Zilliqa/Scilla image to S3.

  ```bash
  cd Zilliqa
  ./scripts/release.sh
  ```

  Go to [AWS webpage](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/zilliqa-release-data/?region=ap-southeast-1&tab=overview) and make sure `<target_testnet>.tar.gz` is uploaded to `S3://zilliqa-release-data`.

- (Optional) Manually confirm the correctness of constant file inside `Zilliqa/constantDir/xxx/constants.xml`. If anything changes, release Zilliqa/Scilla image to S3 again.

  ```bash
  tar cfz <target_testnet>.tar.gz -C <pubKeyPath> pubKeyFile -C $(realpath ./scripts) miner_info.py -C $(realpath release) VERSION -C $(realpath constantsDir) constants.xml -C $(realpath constantsDir/l) constants.xml_lookup -C $(realpath release) <xxx-Linux-Zilliqa.deb> -C $(realpath constantsDir/l2) constants.xml_level2lookup -C $(realpath constantsDir/n) constants.xml_newlookup
  aws s3 cp <target_testnet>.tar.gz s3://zilliqa-release-data/
  ```

  Note the variables `<pubKeyPath>`, `<xxx-Linux-Zilliqa.deb>`, `<target_testnet>` should be changed properly.

- Change directory to `<target_testnet>`.

  ```bash
  cd <target_testnet>
  ```

- Apply rolling upgrade for each `<TYPE>`; once completed, running `finish` will remove unnecessary files (`UPGRADE_DONE`, used to mark this POD is upgraded) and update the commit hash inside `<target_testnet>`/manifest/`<TYPE>`.yaml.

  ```bash
  # Zilliqa only can be upgrade type-by-type
  ./testnet.sh upgrade-all <TYPE>
  ./testnet.sh upgrade-all <TYPE> finish

  # Scilla can be upgrade all types in one shot, or type-by-type
  ./testnet.sh upgrade-all all scilla
  ./testnet.sh upgrade-all all finish scilla
  ```

  `<TYPE>` should be applied in following sequence: {`lookup`, `level2lookup`, `newlookup`, `dsguard`, `normal`}.

- (Optional, Zilliqa only) For verifying pupose, you can specify the start/end index for a small-scale rolling upgrade. (Default: rolling upgrade all if nothing specified)

  ```bash
  ./testnet.sh upgrade-all TYPE <start_node> <end_node>
  ```

- When running the rolling upgrade, separate log files for upgrading pods would be generated under `upgrade_log/` folder.
