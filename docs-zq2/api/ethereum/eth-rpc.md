# Ethereum API

We support a subset of the [Ethereum JSON-RPC API methods](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/). 

See [endpoints](/endpoints.md) for details of which RPC endpoints are supported by each deployed version of Zilliqa 2.0 (TBD: this information will eventually be extracted here for convenience).
